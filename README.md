## Understand Consumer Behavior With Verified Foot Traffic Data

**Background** Visitor and demographic aggregation data provide essential context on population behavior. How often a place of interest is visited, how long do visitors stay, where did they come from, and where are they going? The answers are invaluable in numerous industries. Building financial indicators, city and urban planning, public health indicators, or identifying your primary business competitors all require accurate, high quality population and POI data. 

**Objective** Our workshop’s objective is to provide professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in deriving human movement patterns from location data. We use a sample of our Weekly and Monthly Patterns and Core Places products to perform market research on a potential new coffee shop location. We’ll address these concerns and more in building a market analysis proposal in real time. 

**Questions to Answer** 
- How far are customers willing to travel for coffee? 
- What location will receive the most visibility? 
- Where do most of the coffee customers come from?
